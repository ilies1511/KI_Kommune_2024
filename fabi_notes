Project Idea

To make a real impact on CO₂ emissions, cities need smart infrastructure solutions. Installing IoT traffic sensors city-wide is expensive, and implementing them without understanding their effectiveness leads to inefficient use of resources. Our solution? Build a traffic simulation tool that gives insights into how sensors will perform in different city areas before installation. This simulation helps optimize current installations and offers a data-driven model for future ones.
Why It Matters

By testing virtually, we can identify both underperforming and overperforming sensors, creating ideal setups for each area. This feedback improves machine learning algorithms, which can then predict the best sensor placements across various city areas.

With this approach, even cities with minimal existing data could make informed decisions, as AI-based simulations can fill gaps where sensor data is limited.
Simulation Details

Our model considers various factors influencing traffic and CO₂ output, ensuring realistic scenarios:

    Traffic Hotspots: Areas prone to congestion.
    Weather: Rain, snow, and other conditions impacting traffic flow.
    Traffic Activity Levels: Varies based on time of day.
    Time of Month/Year: Different times impact traffic (e.g., holiday seasons, end-of-month rush).

We’re actively working on:

    Road Closures: Due to construction or accidents.
    Events: High-attendance events that affect traffic.

Future Additions:

    Public Transportation: Influence of buses, trams, etc., on traffic flow.
    Pedestrian Zones & Cycle Lanes: Better integration of all traffic participants.
    Real-Time Accident Data: To create instant rerouting simulations.

Next Steps for Presentation

    Highlight the Cost-Benefit: Emphasize how simulations save resources by ensuring only the most impactful sensor placements.
    Showcase the ML Potential: Outline how data feedback loops make simulations increasingly accurate over time, benefiting cities even with sparse initial data.
    Add a Real-Life Example (if possible): Imagine a specific scenario in Karlsruhe (like a big event) and show how our model would optimize sensor placement to handle traffic surges effectively.

Idea:
Simulation testing for on the edge IOT traffic sensors.

Building infrastructure for anything on a city level will be a costly investment.
Doing simulationts that give insight in how sensors will perform in certain areas before hand can improve the actual impact hugely.
Allready installed sensors can be improved or develop an advanced traffic simulation model that helps future sensor installations.

Simulations can show underperforming but also over performing sensors which is ideal input for machine learning algoryhtems to determine the ideal setup conditions for Sensors.

By making simulations better and better with better and better sensor data as feedback even citys with minimal sensor data could have good results when the missing data is replaced by simulation data and ai


our simultion is influenced by a bunch of diffrent paramters that influence traffic participants diffrently:
-traffic hotspots
-weather
-traffic acifty levels at diffrent times of a day
-time of month/year
currently working on:
-closed roads duo to construction or accidents
-events that attrackt a lot of people
