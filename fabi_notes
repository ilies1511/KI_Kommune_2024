Idea:
Simulation testing for on the edge IOT traffic sensors.

Building infrastructure for anything on a city level will be a costly investment.
Doing simulationts that give insight in how sensors will perform in certain areas before hand can improve the actual impact hugely.
Allready installed sensors can be improved or develop an advanced traffic simulation model that helps future sensor installations.

Simulations can show underperforming but also over performing sensors which is ideal input for machine learning algoryhtems to determine the ideal setup conditions for Sensors.

our simultion is influenced by a bunch of diffrent paramters that influence traffic participants diffrently:
-traffic hotspots
-weather
-traffic acifty levels at diffrent times of a day
-time of month/year
currently working on:
-closed roads duo to construction or accidents
-events that attrackt a lot of people

other future cool influences to add:
